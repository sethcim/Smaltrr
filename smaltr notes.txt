Learnings:
In eagle the group tool is really weird
Symbols and footprints can only be selected at their base points
Keep both editors open at all times
Main Mistake: not enough connectors - connectorize everything
State of charge feedback circuit
Half the USB color maps / pinouts on the internet are wrong
